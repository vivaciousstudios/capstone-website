		<p>My name is Viv, short for Vivian, and I was born and raised in rural, small-town, central Illinois! I graduated from Lake Land College in 2024 with my associate degree in graphic design along with a few extra certificates.</p><p>I am originally from Windsor and graduated from Windsor Jr. &#38; Sr. High School. I am an openly LGBTQIA+ individual expressing my life to the fullest. I love fashion, makeup, and performing in drag. If you want to see some of my drag looks, click<a href="portfolio.html" class="here">here</a>! Itching to see some of my graphic design work or my art? Visit the portfolio page or click which item you'd like to see.
</p>
	  <p>I'm a very creative individual with a passion for design, artwork, and music. I have big hopes and dreams coming from a small town. I hope to grow a social media following for others to have an outlet to express themselves freely. I wish to build a cosmetic business and compete on reality TV. Maybe as you're reading this, I'm filming right now!
